# Random Chess
What happens if chess players make random moves?

29 March 2020:
Today a 10-year-old and I asked, "What happens if chess players make random moves?"

He just learned chess recently and is a keen programmer, so I thought it was only natural that we try programming with some chess! And since "random" was his favourite module in Python, we analysed chess games of random moves in, you guessed it, Python.

Highlights:

1. Human # moves << random # moves (to game end)
2. ~85% games ended in draw/stalemate, ~15% games ended in checkmate
3. Checkmate # moves < stalemate # moves < draw # moves (on average)
